## Update

A better solution since I already use Windows Power Toys

1)Download Sharpkeys https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys

2)Remap capslock to right ctrl -- restart PC for this to apply

3)Install Windows Power Toys

4)Make sure you update the settings. You need to run as administrator you can also set to run at startup

5)Remap keys keys to whatever you want (eg right ctrl + j => left arrow)

## Installation

The setup is as follows

1)Download autohotkeys (https://www.autohotkey.com/)

2)Download current version

3)Install

4)Create or download .ahk file (if you download right click properties and unblock)

5)This is all you need to do but to get this to run on startup

    a)win key + r

    b)run

    c)shell:startup

    d)copy the script in there

## Rebinds

- Deactivates capslock for normal (accidental) use.

- Hold Capslock and drag anywhere in a window to move it (not just the title bar).

- Access the following functions when pressing Capslock:
  Cursor keys - J, K, L, I

  Enter - Space

  Home, PgDn, PgUp, End - U, O, Y, H

  Backspace and Del - N, M

  Insert - B

  Select all - A

  Cut, copy, paste - S, D, F

  Close tab, window - W, E

  Esc - R

  Next, previous tab - Tab, Q

  Undo, redo - , and .

  shift, ctrl - x and c

- Numpad at the right hand resting position when holding Ctrl+Shift+Alt (using keys m,.jkluio and spacebar)

To use capslock as you normally would, you can press WinKey + Capslock
